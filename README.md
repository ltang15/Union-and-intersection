# Union-and-intersection
"consider the two sorted, unique arrays (sets) left and right:

left: [5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40]

right: [3,10.13,20,23,28,30,33,35]

the union of the two sets is a sorted, unique list that contains all the elements from the two arrays left and right: 

union: [3,5,10,13,15,20,23,25,28,30,33,35,40]

the intersection of the two arrays is a sorted, unique list that contains the common elements of the two arrays:

intersection: [10,20,30,35]"
